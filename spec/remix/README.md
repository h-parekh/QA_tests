# Remix QA Specs

The Remix platform was redesigned in July of 2018, and testing was itegrated directly into the delivery pipeline. The previous QA specs for the Remix service are no longer needed as the underlying application has drastically changed.

## Rationale

The Remix service is now a static web page and no longer has features such as system login that need to be tested. As such, the Hesburgh Libraries have migrated the QA Specs to [ndlib/remix-blueprints](https://github.com/ndlib/remix-blueprints/tree/master/spec).
