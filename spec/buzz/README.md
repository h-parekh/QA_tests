# Buzz QA Specs

The Buzz specs have been migrated to Newman, and moved into the Buzz repository in ndlib.

The old Ruby specs can be [found here.](../retired/buzz)

The current specs can be accessed [in the Buzz repository.](https://github.com/ndlib/buzz/tree/master/spec/postman).

## Rationale

This decision was made in order to store the functional tests closer to the application code, rather than needing to pull a separate repository to run functional tests. The previous code was kept along a separate path to retain institutional knowledge and to protect against the potential loss of test coverage.
